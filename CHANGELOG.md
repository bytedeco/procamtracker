### March 29, 2012
 * Added new `RealityAugmentor.ObjectSettings.surfaceHasTexture` property to have ProCamTracker rectify the projector display on textureless surface planes, using either the `FULL_FRAME` or the centered `HALF_FRAME` of the camera image, specified by the `roiAcquisitionMethod` property
 * Renamed a few other `Settings` properties to reflect better their meanings

### February 18, 2012
 * `TrackingWorker` now fully support tracking with OpenCL and OpenGL acceleration (when `useOpenCL` is checked)
 * New `TrackingWorker.projectorBufferingSize` (in number of frames to buffer) and `proCamPhaseShift` (in milliseconds) settings to compensate for the delay of the projector display, and of the camera capture as well, while still allowing processing at high FPS
 * Accelerated and parallelized execution of `RealityAugmentor`
 * Updated `ObjectFinder` adding `useFLANN` to its `Settings` properties, letting it use FLANN via OpenCV
 * Cleaned up and optimized `HandMouse`
 * Renamed some `Settings` properties here and there to correct typos and reflect better their meanings

### January 8, 2012
 * Should now have an easier time automatically finding OpenCV libraries inside standard directories such as `/usr/local/lib/`, `/opt/local/lib/`, and `C:\opencv\`, even when they are not part of the system configuration or PATH
 * New `PS3EyeFrameGrabber` from Jiri Masa can now grab images using the SDK from Code Laboratories

### October 1, 2011
 * Fixed `DC1394FrameGrabber` and `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber` to behave as expected with all Bayer/Raw/Mono/RGB/YUV cameras modes (within the limits of libdc1394 and PGR FlyCapture)

### August 21, 2011
 * Upgraded support to OpenCV 2.3.1
 * `OpenCVFrameGrabber` now detects when CV_CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC is broken and gives up calling `cvGetCaptureProperty()`

### July 5, 2011
 * Upgraded support to OpenCV 2.3.0
 * Fixed `OpenKinectFrameGrabber` and `FFmpegFrameGrabber`

### June 10, 2011
 * New `OpenKinectFrameGrabber` to capture from Microsoft's Kinect stereo camera using OpenKinect
 * The Unix scripts now check for a 64-bit JVM in priority

### May 11, 2011
 * Changed `Marker.getCenter()` back to the centroid, because it has better noise averaging properties and gives in practice more accurate results than the actual center
 * Added hack to `OpenCVFrameGrabber.start()` to wait for `cvRetrieveFrame()` to return something else than `null` under Mac OS X
 * Added to the scripts `-Dapple.awt.fullscreencapturealldisplays=false` Java option required for full-screen support under Mac OS X 
 * Removed from the scripts the default `-Dsun.java2d.opengl=True` Java option, because since NVIDIA Release 260 family of drivers, most video drivers under Linux do not have good OpenGL support anymore
 * `FFmpegFrameGrabber` now works properly on Windows with newer binaries
 * New `VideoInputFrameGrabber` to capture using DirectShow, useful under Windows 7 where OpenCV and FFmpeg can fail to capture using Video for Windows
 * Changed the output of `monitorWindows` slightly to accommodate better the `HandMouse`

### April 7, 2011
 * Added a `format` property to camera settings, mostly useful for `FFmpegFrameGrabber`, where interesting values include "dv1394", "mjpeg", "video4linux2", "vfwcap", and "x11grab"
 * Added hack to make sure the temporarily extracted library files get properly deleted under Windows
 * Added (rudimentary) outlier detection and modified zero threshold handling 
 * Added new `HandMouse` and `RealityAugmentor` features
 * Fixed `ProjectiveDevice.distort()`, which mistakenly undistorted projector images instead

### February 19, 2011
 * Upgraded to the latest version of JavaCV based on JavaCPP instead of JNA, featuring better performance
 * Enhanced a few things of the image alignment algorithm
 * Tried to fix image format conversion inside `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber`, but this is going to require more careful debugging

### November 4, 2010
 * Renamed the package namespace to `com.googlecode.javacv.procamtracker`, which makes more sense now that JavaCV has been well anchored at Google Code for more than a year, piggybacking on the unique and easy-to-remember domain name, but this means you will need to manually edit any old XML `settings.pct` files and rename the namespace of the classes inside
 * `CanvasFrame` now redraws its `Canvas` after the user resizes the `Frame`
 * Added check to `DC1394FrameGrabber` so that a "Failed to initialize libdc1394" does not crash the JVM
 * `FrameGrabber` now selects the default grabber a bit better
 * Made sweeping changes (for the better, but still not finalized) to `GNImageAligner`, `ProjectiveTransformer`, `ProjectiveGainBiasTransformer`, and `ProCamTransformer`...
 * Fixed display issues with the mouse cursor on Windows, and made a few small cosmetic changes
 * Now tries harder to release native memory on time

### July 30, 2010
 * Fixed crash that would occur in `CanvasFrame` for some video drivers
 * Fixed crash inside the code for direct alignment caused by the ROI getting set outside the image plane
 * Added `deltaScale` and `tryToFixPlane` settings to `GNImageAligner` (the first used as increment, randomly selected forward or backward, for finite difference), which sometimes help to jump over local minima

### May 30, 2010
 * Fixed speed setting problem with the `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber`

### April 16, 2010
 * Modified a few things to get better default behavior of gamma correction
 * `Camera.triggerFlushSize` now defaults to 5 (only affects `OpenCVFrameGrabber` and `FFmpegFrameGrabber`)
 * Replaced `LMImageAligner` by `GNImageAligner`, a more appropriate name for Gauss-Newton with `lineSearch`

### April 8, 2010
 * Added support for OpenCV 2.1

### April 5, 2010
 * Fixed mouse cursor under Windows when `objectRoiAcquisition == USER`
 * Added new `VirtualBall` visual element
 * Fixed up the `Chronometer` a bit
 * Added `projectorVideoFile` setting, whose images get merged with `projectorImageFile`
 * Some bugs fixed for FFmpeg

### March 21, 2010
 * Initial release
